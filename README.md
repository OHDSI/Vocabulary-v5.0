Vocabulary
==========

This repo contains the build process for the Standard Vocabularies, which is part of ATHENA. We will consolidate this with the download page at some point in the future.

**You do not have to clone and run this to create a vocabulary.** Instead, download all the necessary files from http://www.ohdsi.org/web/athena.

If you do want to recreate the vocabulary please find the step-by-step description in each vocabulary's README.
