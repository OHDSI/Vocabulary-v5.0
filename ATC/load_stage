Prerequisites:
1. Get the latest file from source, name it class_drugs_scraper. The file should contain class code, class name, additional information.
For example, for ATC the file will be created in the following manner:
SELECT id, atc_code AS class_code, atc_name AS class_name, ddd, u, adm_r, note, description, ddd_description
FROM atc_drugs_scraper;
2. Prepare input tables (drug_concept_stage, internal_relationship_stage, relationship_to_concept)
according to the general rules for drug vocabularies
3. Prepare the following tables:
- reference (represents the original code and concantinated code and its drug forms in RxNorm format)
- class_to_drug_manual (stores manual mappings, i.g. Insulins)


-- 1. Update latest_update field to new date
DO $_$
BEGIN
	PERFORM VOCABULARY_PACK.SetLatestUpdate(
	pVocabularyName			=> 'ATC',
	pVocabularyDate			=> (SELECT vocabulary_date FROM sources.rxnatomarchive LIMIT 1),
	pVocabularyVersion		=> (SELECT vocabulary_version FROM sources.rxnatomarchive LIMIT 1),
	pVocabularyDevSchema	=> 'DEV_ATC'
);
END $_$;

-- 2. Truncate all working tables AND remove indices
TRUNCATE TABLE concept_stage;
TRUNCATE TABLE concept_relationship_stage;
TRUNCATE TABLE concept_synonym_stage;
TRUNCATE TABLE pack_content_stage;
TRUNCATE TABLE drug_strength_stage;
