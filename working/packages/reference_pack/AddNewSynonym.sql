Adds new synonym

Usage:
DO $_$

  PERFORM vocabulary_pack.AddNewSynonym(
    pConcept_id          =>123,
    pSynonym_name        =>'test synonym',
    pLanguage_concept_id =>4180186

END $_$;

OR you can combine with the AddNewConcept:

DO $_$
BEGIN
  PERFORM vocabulary_pack.AddNewSynonym(
    pConcept_id          =>vocabulary_pack.AddNewConcept(
                            pConcept_name     =>'test concept name 5',

    pSynonym_name        =>'test synonym 5',
    pLanguage_concept_id =>4180186

OR you can combine it with itself:

DO $_$
BEGIN
PERFORM vocabulary_pack.AddNewSynonym(
  pConcept_id=>vocabulary_pack.AddNewSynonym(
      pConcept_id          =>vocabulary_pack.AddNewConcept(
